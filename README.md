KawanSurya is an innovative application that aims to assist individuals in Indonesia in making informed decisions about rooftop PV systems. The application considers two important factors that can influence the decision to install a rooftop PV system: technical aspects and economic factors.

Firstly, KawanSurya provides detailed analysis of the technical aspects of a rooftop PV system. This includes assessing the potential electricity generation from solar PV compared to overall electricity consumption. The application takes into account various factors such as location, orientation, roof shading, as well as the efficiency and output of the solar panels used. By analyzing these factors, KawanSurya can provide accurate estimates of the energy output potential and savings that can be achieved through the installation of a rooftop PV system.

Secondly, KawanSurya evaluates the economic feasibility of investing in a rooftop PV system. This includes analyzing the installation costs, as well as the expected return on investment over time. The application considers various financial metrics such as payback period, net present value (NPV), and return on investment (ROI). Additionally, KawanSurya assesses the regulations regarding exporting solar PV electricity to the PLN grid, ensuring that users are aware of any regulatory barriers or incentives that may affect the economic feasibility of their investment.

Overall, KawanSurya provides a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of rooftop PV systems in the On-Grid system in Indonesia. By considering both the technical and economic aspects of the investment, KawanSurya can help users make informed decisions about installing a rooftop PV system, ensuring that they are not only environmentally sustainable but also financially viable.

-The load parameter will determine the amount of electrical load that can be handled by the PV system's output, the load that is not covered by the PV system's output, and the amount of PV output that is exported back to the grid.

-The location parameter will determine the level of solar radiation present at the user-specified location. Solar radiation data is obtained from the 2005-2016 PVGIS-SARAH database, which also takes into account the horizon profile. Solar radiation and PV output will vary if there are hills or mountains obstructing sunlight during certain periods of the day. PVGIS can calculate this effect using elevation data. However, this calculation does not consider shading from nearby objects such as buildings or trees.

-The technical parameter allows users to specify several specifications of the rooftop PV system to be installed, and this greatly helps KawanSurya in calculating the rooftop PV output and investment calculations.

-The economic parameter allows users to determine the economic specifications of the rooftop PV system to be installed, and this greatly helps KawanSurya in calculating the investment calculations for the rooftop PV system.
